human is a PHP extension for converting time intervals into human-readable formats.

human was mostly written as an exercise, but if someone wants to use it, they are welcome to. I will eventually make it a pecl package (once again, for exercise)

see human.php for usage examples

Functions:

human_interval_precise($seconds)
breaks the given number of seconds up into largest precise unit possible (i.e. the largest unit you can get to is weeks, since months vary in length)
